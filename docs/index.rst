Welcome to Snakemake's API documentation!
=========================================

Build systems like GNU Make are frequently used to create complicated workflows, e.g. in bioinformatics. This project aims to reduce the complexity of creating workflows by providing a fast and comfortable execution environment, together with a clean and modern domain specific specification language (DSL) in python style.

Apart from being a command line tool, Snakemake can also be called from withing other python code and hence serve as a framework for organizing workflows withing your software. These pages describe the public parts of the Snakemake api.

For the user documentation and general information, see https://bitbucket.org/johanneskoester/snakemake.
